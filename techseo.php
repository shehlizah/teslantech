                        <p class="text-white-50 d-none d-sm-block mt-4">Technical SEO stands as one of the most important aspects of any successful SEO campaign. Without technical competence, your website could miss out on the visibility it deserves. Our team offer full site technical audits, as well as consultancy and optimization services. Google’s ability to understand a website is directly impacted by technical SEO. From the initial crawl to the rendering and indexing of your site, technical deficiencies can raise challenges for search engine user-agents and their indexing systems, leading to lost organic visibility. Furthermore, poor technical health can often have a negative impact on all areas of your site, hampering the success of content and site usability.</p>

                        <p class="text-white-50 d-none d-sm-block mt-4">While the necessity and specific work required changes with each business, nearly every website will have some technical pitfalls present.<br>
                            The nature of a growing domain means that issues arise and often go unchecked, hidden away under the surface. Worse still, the necessity for websites to serve multiple devices and include complex functionality creates additional problems that can be lost without proper technical understanding.<br>
                            Technical SEO isn’t a one-time task either; a successful domain will maintain excellent technical health at all times, ensuring that search engines can efficiently crawl, render and interpret each page. For this reason, partnering with a technical SEO agency is vital to your SEO campaign.

                        <p class="text-white-50 d-none d-sm-block mt-4">No site is going to be technically perfect and as complexity rises, so too does the propensity for technical issues to arise.<br>
                            Google’s best practice guidelines list a vast array of potential challenges, some or all of which your website may be a victim of. The inference is to go ahead, fix everything and move forward. The reality, however, is that many technical fixes are time-consuming and resource-intensive, often with marginal gains in organic performance relative to your investment.<br>
                            Impression’s consultants will strategies an approach to optimization based on your technical health and organic performance, prioritizing the issues that are holding you back and enact change that leads to tangible improvement in performance and deliver real-world ROI.
